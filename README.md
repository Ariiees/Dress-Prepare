# Quick Start on Implementation

Go Dress-Prepare/app/src/main/res/drawable to find/add png component (they are used in layout.xml)

Go Dress-Prepare/app/src/main/res/layout to add/modify new/existing pages (they are used in task.java)

Go Dress-Prepare/app/src/main/java/com/example/dresscode to find all our Java class code framwork

Notice: when you trying to add a new java class, please go Dress-Prepare/app/src/main and register a new activity in AndoirdManifest.xml
otherwise when you trying to enter your new class the code will break.

The whole project structure is: 

- MainActivity -> for loading screen and jump to Home
- Util -> for all utility function or code (please write as **public static** function for usage
- DressCode -> dresscoe page that offer drop down list
- Home -> WIP Home page that show basic idea of app
- Weather -> WIP should be weather page
